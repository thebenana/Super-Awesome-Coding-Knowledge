The Declaration of Independence of The United States of AmericaWhen in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary forone people to dissolve the political bands which have connectedthem with another, and to assume, among the Powers of the earth,the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature andof Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinionsof mankind requires that they should declare the causes whichimpel them to the separation.We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men,deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends,it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institutenew Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizingits powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effecttheir Safety and Happiness.  Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governmentslong established should not be changed for light and transient causes;and accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposedto suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishingthe forms to which they are accustomed.  But when a long train of abuses andusurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reducethem under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throwoff such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is nowthe necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government.The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeatedinjuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishmentof an absolute Tyranny over these States.  To prove this, let Factsbe submitted to a candid world.He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessaryfor the public good.He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediateand pressing importance, unless suspended in their operationtill his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended,he has utterly neglected to attend to them.He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation oflarge districts of people, unless those people would relinquishthe right of Representation in the Legislature, a rightinestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual,uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of theirPublic Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing theminto compliance with his measures.He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposingwith manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions,to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative Powers,incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at largefor their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposedto all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States;for that purpose obstructing the Laws of Naturalization of Foreigners;refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither,and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assentto Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.He has made judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenureof their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms ofOfficers to harass our People, and eat out their substance.He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armieswithout the Consent of our legislatures.He has affected to render the Military independent ofand superior to the Civil Power.He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdictionforeign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws;giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended legislation:For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment for any Murderswhich they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:For imposing taxes on us without our Consent:For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouringProvince, establishing therein an Arbitrary government,
and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at oncean example and fit instrument for introducing the sameabsolute rule into these Colonies:For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws,and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselvesinvested with Power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protectionand waging War against us.He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns,and destroyed the lives of our people.He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenariesto compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begunwith circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in themost barbarous ages, and totally unworthy of the Head of a civilized nation.He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seasto bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners oftheir friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and hasendeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers,the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare,is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redressin the most humble terms:  Our repeated Petitions have been answeredonly by repeated injury.  A Prince, whose character is thus markedby every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the rulerof a free People.Nor have We been wanting in attention to our British brethren.We have warned them from time to time of attempts by theirlegislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration andsettlement here.  We have appealed to their native justiceand magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of ourcommon kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitablyinterrupt our connections and correspondence.  They too have beendeaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity.  We must, therefore,acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them,as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America,in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge ofthe world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name,and by the Authority of the good People of these Colonies,solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are,
and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States;that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown,and that all political connection between them and the Stateof Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved;and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power tolevy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce,and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States mayof right do.  And for the support of this Declaration, with a firmreliance on the Protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledgeto each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.December, 1972  [Etext #2]****The Project Gutenberg Etext of The U.

that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship,support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival andthe success of liberty.  This much we pledge. . .and more.To those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share:we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends.  United. . .there islittle we cannot do in a host of co-operative ventures.Divided. . .there is little we can do. . .for we dare not meeta powerful challenge, at odds, and split asunder.To those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free:we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall nothave passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny.We shall not always expect to find them supporting our view.But we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting theirown freedom. . .and to remember that. . .in the past. . .those whofoolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside.To those people in the huts and villages of half the globestruggling to break the bonds of mass misery:  we pledge our bestefforts to help them help themselves, for whatever periodis required. . .not because the Communists may be doing it,not because we seek their votes, but because it is right.If a free society cannot help the many who are poor,it cannot save the few who are rich.To our sister republics south of our border:  we offer a special pledge. . .to convert our good words into good deeds. . .in a new alliance for progress. . .to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains ofpoverty.  But this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey ofhostile powers.  Let all our neighbors know that we shall join with themto oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the Americas. . .and letevery other power know that this hemisphere intends to remain the masterof its own house.To that world assembly of sovereign states:  the United Nations. . .our last best hope in an age where the instruments of warhave far outpaced the instruments of peace, we renew our pledgeof support. . .to prevent it from becoming merely a forum forinvective. . .to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak. . .and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run.Finally, to those nations who would make themselves our adversaries,we offer not a pledge but a request:  that both sides begin anewthe quest for peace; before the dark powers of destruction unleashedby science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction.We dare not tempt them with weakness.  For only when our arms are sufficientbeyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed.But neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort fromour present course. . .both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons,
both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racingto alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of Mankind'sfinal war.So let us begin anew. . .remembering on both sides that civilityis not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof.Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.Let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboringthose problems which divide us.  Let both sides, for the first time,formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection andcontrol of arms. . .and bring the absolute power to destroyother nations under the absolute control of all nations.Let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science insteadof its terrors.  Together let us explore the stars, conquer thedeserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths, and encouragethe arts and commerce.  Let both sides unite to heed in all cornersof the earth the command of Isaiah. . .to "undo the heavy burdens. . .let the oppressed go free."And if a beachhead of co-operation may push back the jungle of suspicion. . .let both sides join in creating not a new balance of power. . .but a new world of law. . .where the strong are just. . .and the weak secure. . .and the peace preserved. . . .All this will not be finished in the first one hundred days.Nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days. . .nor in the life of this administration, nor even perhapsin our lifetime on this planet.  But let us begin.In your hands, my fellow citizens. . .more than mine. . .will rest thefinal success or failure of our course.  Since this country was founded,each generation of Americans has been summoned to give testimonyto its national loyalty.  The graves of young Americans who answeredthe call to service surround the globe.  Now the trumpet summons us again. . .not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need. . .not as a call to battle. . .though embattled we are. . .but a call to bear the burden of a longtwilight struggle. . .year in and year out, rejoicing in hope,patient in tribulation. . .a struggle against the common enemies of man:tyranny. . .poverty. . .disease. . .and war itself.  Can we forge againstthese enemies a grand and global alliance. . .North and South. . .East and West. . .that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind?Will you join in that historic effort?In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been grantedthe role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger; I do not shrinkfrom this responsibility. . .I welcome it.  I do not believe that any of uswould exchange places with any other people or any other generation.The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor
will light our country and all who serve it. . .and the glow fromthat fire can truly light the world.And so, my fellow Americans. . .ask not what your country cando for you. . .ask what you can do for your country.  My fellowcitizens of the world. . .ask not what America will do for you,but what together we can do for the Freedom of Man.Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world,ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrificewhich we ask of you.  With a good conscience our only sure reward,with history the final judge of our deeds; let us go forth to leadthe land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing thathere on earth God's work must truly be our own.December, 1974  [Etext #4]**The Project Gutenberg Etext of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address**This is a retranscription of one of the first ProjectGutenberg Etexts, offically dated December 31, 1974--and now officially re-released on November 19, 1993--130 years after it was spoken.

[Which was the Virgina ProvincialConvention, March 23, 1775]Give Me Liberty Or Give Me DeathPatrick Henry, March 23, 1775.No man thinks more highly than I do of the patriotism, as well as abilities,of the very worthy gentlemen who have just addressed the House.  But different
men often see the same subject in different lights; and, therefore, I hope itwill not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen if, entertaining as I doopinions of a character very opposite to theirs, I shall speak forth mysentiments freely and without reserve.  This is no time for ceremony.The questing before the House is one of awful moment to this country.For my own part, I consider it as nothing less than a question offreedom or slavery; and in proportion to the magnitude of the subjectought to be the freedom of the debate.  It is only in this way thatwe can hope to arrive at truth, and fulfill the great responsibilitywhich we hold to God and our country.  Should I keep back my opinionsat such a time, through fear of giving offense, I should consider myselfas guilty of treason towards my country, and of an act of disloyaltytoward the Majesty of Heaven, which I revere above all earthly kings.Mr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope.We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to thesong of that siren till she transforms us into beasts.  Is this the partof wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty?Are we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see not,and, having ears, hear not, the things which so nearly concern theirtemporal salvation?  For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost,I am willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it.I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp ofexperience.  I know of no way of judging of the future but by the past.And judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the conductof the British ministry for the last ten years to justify those hopes withwhich  gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the House.Is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received?Trust it not, sir; it will prove a snare to your feet.  Suffer not yourselvesto be betrayed with a kiss.  Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of ourpetition comports with those warlike preparations which cover our waters anddarken our land.  Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love andreconciliation?  Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled thatforce must be called in to win back our love?  Let us not deceive ourselves,sir.  These are the implements of war and subjugation; the last arguments towhich kings resort.  I ask gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array, ifits purpose be not to force us to submission?  Can gentlemen assign any otherpossible motive for it?  Has Great Britain any enemy, in this quarter ofthe world, to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies?  No, sir,she has none.  They are meant for us:  they can be meant for no other.
They are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which the Britishministry have been so long forging.  And what have we to oppose to them?Shall we try argument?  Sir, we have been trying that for the last ten years.Have we anything new to offer upon the subject?  Nothing.  We have held thesubject up in every light of which it is capable; but it has been all in vain.Shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication?  What terms shall wefind which have not been already exhausted?  Let us not, I beseech you, sir,deceive ourselves.  Sir, we have done everything that could be done to avertthe storm which is now coming on.  We have petitioned; we have remonstrated;we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and haveimplored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry andParliament.  Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have producedadditional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded;and we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne!In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace andreconciliation.  There is no longer any room for hope.  If we wish to be free--if we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for whichwe have been so long contending--if we mean not basely to abandon the noblestruggle in which we have been so long engaged, and which we have pledgedourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contestshall be obtained--we must fight!  I repeat it, sir, we must fight!An appeal to arms  and to the God of hosts is all that is left us!They tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidablean adversary.  But when shall we be stronger?  Will it be the next week,or the next year?  Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a Britishguard shall be stationed in every house?  Shall we gather strength butirresolution and inaction?  Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistanceby lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope, untilour enemies shall have bound us hand and foot?  Sir, we are not weak if we makea proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power.The millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such acountry as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemycan send against us.  Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone.There is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations, and who will
raise up friends to fight our battles for us.  The battle, sir, is not to thestrong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave.  Besides, sir,we have no election.  If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too lateto retire from the contest.  There is no retreat but in submission and slavery!Our chains are forged!  Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston!The war is inevitable--and let it come!  I repeat it, sir, let it come.It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter.  Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace--but there is no peace.  The war is actually begun!  The next gale that sweepsfrom the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms!Our brethren are already in the field!  Why stand we here idle?What is it that gentlemen wish?  What would they have?  Is life so dear,or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery?Forbid it, Almighty God!  I know not what course others may take;but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!Officially released December 31, 1977  [Etext #7]Officially re-released November 25, 1993In honor of Thanksgiving******The Project Gutenberg Etext of The Mayflower Compact*****The Mayflower CompactNovember 11, 1620  [This was November 21, old style calendar]In the name of God, Amen.

Then a statement, somewhatin detail, of a course to be pursued, seemed fitting and proper.Now, at the expiration of four years, during which public declarationshave been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the greatcontest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energiesof the nation, little that is new could be presented.  The progressof our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as well knownto the public as to myself; and it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory
and encouraging to all.  With high hope for the future, no predictionin regard to it is ventured.On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago, all thoughtswere anxiously directed to an impending civil war.  All dreaded it--all sought to avert it.  While the inaugural address was being deliveredfrom this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war,insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war--seeking to dissolve the Union, and divide effects, by negotiation.Both parties deprecated war; but one of them would make war ratherthan let the nation survive; and the other would accept war ratherthan let it perish.  And the war came.One-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributedgenerally over the Union, but localized in the Southern part of it.These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest.  All knewthat this interest was, somehow, the cause of the war.  To strengthen,perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which theinsurgents would rend the Union, even by war; while the government claimedno right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it.Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the durationwhich it has already attained.  Neither anticipated that the causeof the conflict might cease with, or even before, the conflict itselfshould cease.  Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result lessfundamental and astounding.  Both read the same Bible, and prayto the same God; and each invokes his aid against the other.It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God'sassistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces;but let us judge not, that we be not judged.  The prayers of bothcould not be answered--that of neither has been answered fully.The Almighty has his own purposes.  "Woe unto the world becauseof offenses! for it must needs be that offenses come; but woeto that man by whom the offense cometh."  If we shall supposethat American slavery is one of those offenses which, in theprovidence of God, must needs come, but which, having continuedthrough his appointed time, he now wills to remove, and that hegives to both North and South this terrible war, as the woe dueto those by whom the offense came, shall we discern therein anydeparture from those divine attributes which the believers in aliving God always ascribe to him?  Fondly do we hope--ferventlydo we pray--that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away.Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled bythe bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toilshall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn by the lashshall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was saidthree thousand years ago, so still it must be said, "Thejudgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether."With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness inthe right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive onto finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds;to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow,
and his orphan--to do all which may achieve and cherish a justand lasting peace among ourselves, and with all nations.December, 1978  [Etext #9]The Project Gutenberg Etext of Lincoln's 1st Inaugural AddressLincoln's First Inaugural AddressMarch 4, 1861Fellow citizens of the United States:  in compliance with a custom as oldas the government itself, I appear before you to address you brieflyand to take, in your presence, the oath prescribed by the Constitutionof the United States, to be taken by the President "before he enterson the execution of his office."I do not consider it necessary, at present, for me to discuss those mattersof administration about which there is no special anxiety, or excitement.Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern Statesthat by the accession of a Republican administration their propertyand their peace and personal security are to be endangered.There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension.Indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the whileexisted and been open to their inspection.  It is found innearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you.I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that"I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere withthe institution of slavery where it exists.  I believe I haveno lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so."Those who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledgethat I had made this and many similar declarations, and hadnever recanted them.  And, more than this, they placed in theplatform for my acceptance, and as a law to themselves and to me,the clear and emphatic resolution which I now read:"Resolved:  that the maintenance inviolateof the rights of the States, and especiallythe right of each State to order and controlits own domestic institutions according toits own judgment exclusively, is essentialto that balance of power on which the perfectionand endurance of our political fabric depend,and we denounce the lawless invasion by armedforce of the soil of any State or Territory,no matter under what pretext,
as among the gravest of crimes."I now reiterate these sentiments; and, in doing so, I only press uponthe public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the caseis susceptible, that the property, peace, and security of no sectionare to be in any wise endangered by the now incoming administration.I add, too, that all the protection which, consistently with theConstitution and the laws, can be given, will be cheerfully givento all the States when lawfully demanded, for whatever cause--as cheerfully to one section as to another.There is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitivesfrom service or labor.  The clause I now read is as plainlywritten in the Constitution as any other of its provisions:"No person held to service or labor in one State,under the laws thereof, escaping into another,shall in consequence of any law or regulationtherein be discharged from such service or labor,but shall be delivered up on claim of the partyto whom such service or labor may be due."It is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by thosewho made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves;and the intention of the lawgiver is the law.  All membersof Congress swear their support to the whole Constitution--to this provision as much as to any other.  To the proposition,then, that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause"shall be delivered up", their oaths are unanimous.  Now, if theywould make the effort in good temper, could they not with nearlyequal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which to keep goodthat unanimous oath?There is some difference of opinion whether this clause shouldbe enforced by national or by State authority; but surely thatdifference is not a very material one.  If the slave is to besurrendered, it can be of but little consequence to him or to othersby which authority it is done.  And should any one in any case becontent that his oath shall go unkept on a merely unsubstantialcontroversy as to HOW it shall be kept?Again, in any law upon this subject, ought not all the safeguards ofliberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced,so that a free man be not, in any case, surrendered as a slave?And might it not be well at the same time to provide by law for theenforcement of that clause in the Constitution which guarantees that"the citizen of each State shall be entitled to all privileged andimmunities of citizens in the several States?"I take the official oath today with no mental reservations,and with no purpose to construe the Constitution or laws byany hypercritical rules.  And while I do not choose now to specifyparticular acts of Congress as proper to be enforced, I do suggestthat it will be much safer for all, both in official and private stations,
to conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed,than to violate any of them, trusting to find impunity in havingthem held to be unConstitutional.It is seventy-two years since the first inauguration of a Presidentunder our national Constitution.  During that period fifteen differentand greatly distinguished citizens have, in succession, administeredthe executive branch of the government.  They have conducted it throughmany perils, and generally with great success.  Yet, with all this scopeof precedent, I now enter upon the same task for the brief Constitutionalterm of four years under great and peculiar difficulty.  A disruption ofthe Federal Union, heretofore only menaced, is now formidably attempted.I hold that, in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution,the Union of these States is perpetual.  Perpetuity is implied,if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments.It is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provisionin its organic law for its own termination.  Continue to execute allthe express provisions of our National Constitution, and the Union willendure forever--it being impossible to destroy it except by some actionnot provided for in the instrument itself.Again, if the United States be not a government proper, but an associationof States in the nature of contract merely, can it, as a contract,be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it?One party to a contract may violate it--break it, so to speak;but does it not require all to lawfully rescind it?Descending from these general principles, we find the propositionthat in legal contemplation the Union is perpetual confirmed bythe history of the Union itself.  The Union is much older thanthe Constitution.  It was formed, in fact, by the Articles ofAssociation in 1774.  It was matured and continued by theDeclaration of Independence in 1776.  It was further matured,and the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly plightedand engaged that it should be perpetual, by the Articles of Confederationin 1778.  And, finally, in 1787 one of the declared objects for ordainingand establishing the Constitution was "TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION."But if the destruction of the Union by one or by a part only of the Statesbe lawfully possible, the Union is LESS perfect than before the Constitution,having lost the vital element of perpetuity.It follows from these views that no State upon its own mere motioncan lawfully get out of the Union; that Resolves and Ordinancesto that effect are legally void; and that acts of violence,within any State or States, against the authority of the United States,are insurrectionary or revolutionary, according to circumstances.I therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and the laws,the Union is unbroken; and to the extent of my ability I shall take care,as the Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that thelaws of the Union be faithfully executed in all the States.
Doing this I deem to be only a simple duty on my part;and I shall perform it so far as practicable, unless myrightful masters, the American people, shall withhold therequisite means, or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary.I trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as thedeclared purpose of the Union that it WILL Constitutionallydefend and maintain itself.In doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence; and thereshall be none, unless it be forced upon the national authority.The power confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possessthe property and places belonging to the government, and to collectthe duties and imposts; but beyond what may be necessary for these objects,there will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the peopleanywhere.  Where hostility to the United States, in any interior locality,shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizensfrom holding the Federal offices, there will be no attempt to forceobnoxious strangers among the people for that object.  While the strictlegal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise ofthese offices, the attempt to do so would be so irritating,and so nearly impracticable withal, that I deem it betterto forego for the time the uses of such offices.The mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished in all partsof the Union.  So far as possible, the people everywhere shall have thatsense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thoughtand reflection.  The course here indicated will be followed unless currentevents and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper,and in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercisedaccording to circumstances actually existing, and with a view anda hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and therestoration of fraternal sympathies and affections.That there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroythe Union at all events, and are glad of any pretext to do it, I willneither affirm nor deny; but if there be such, I need address no wordto them.  To those, however, who really love the Union may I not speak?Before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of ournational fabric, with all its benefits, its memories, and its hopes,would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it?Will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibilitythat any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence?Will you, while the certain ills you fly to are greater than allthe real ones you fly from--will you risk the commission of sofearful a mistake?All profess to be content in the Union if all Constitutional rightscan be maintained.  Is it true, then, that any right, plainly writtenin the Constitution, has been denied?  I think not.  Happily the humanmind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this.
Think, if you can, of a single instance in which a plainly written provisionof the Constitution has ever been denied.  If by the mere force of numbers amajority should deprive a minority of any clearly written Constitutional right,it might, in a moral point of view, justify revolution--certainly would if sucha right were a vital one.  But such is not our case.  All the vital rights ofminorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmationsand negations, guaranties and prohibitions, in the Constitution, thatcontroversies never arise concerning them.  But no organic law can ever beframed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which mayoccur in practical administration.  No foresight can anticipate,nor any document of reasonable length contain, express provisionsfor all possible questions.  Shall fugitives from labor be surrenderedby national or State authority?  The Constitution does not expressly say.May Congress prohibit slavery in the Territories?  The Constitution does notexpressly say.  MUST Congress protect slavery in the Territories?The Constitution does not expressly say.From questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies,and we divide upon them into majorities and minorities.  If the minoritywill not acquiesce, the majority must, or the government must cease.There is no other alternative; for continuing the government isacquiescence on one side or the other.If a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce,they make a precedent which in turn will divide and ruin them;for a minority of their own will secede from them whenevera majority refuses to be controlled by such minority.For instance, why may not any portion of a newconfederacy a year or two hence arbitrarily secede again,precisely as portions of the present Union now claim to secede from it?All who cherish disunion sentiments are now being educated to theexact temper of doing this.Is there such perfect identity of interests among the Statesto compose a new Union, as to produce harmony only,and prevent renewed secession?Plainly, the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy.A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations,and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popularopinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people.Whoever rejects it does, of necessity, fly to anarchy or to despotism.Unanimity is impossible; the rule of a minority, as a permanent arrangement,is wholly inadmissible; so that, rejecting the majority principle,anarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left.
I do not forget the position, assumed by some, that Constitutionalquestions are to be decided by the Supreme Court; nor do I denythat such decisions must be binding, in any case, upon the partiesto a suit, as to the object of that suit, while they are also entitledto very high respect and consideration in all parallel cases by all otherdepartments of the government.  And while it is obviously possible thatsuch decision may be erroneous in any given case, still the evil effectfollowing it, being limited to that particular case, with the chance thatit may be overruled and never become a precedent for other cases,can better be borne than could the evils of a different practice.At the same time, the candid citizen must confess that if the policyof the government, upon vital questions affecting the whole people,is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court,the instant they are made, in ordinary litigation between partiesin personal actions, the people will have ceased to be their own rulers,having to that extent practically resigned their government into the handsof that eminent tribunal.  Nor is there in this view any assault uponthe court or the judges.  It is a duty from which they may not shrinkto decide cases properly brought before them, and it is no fault oftheirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes.One section of our country believes slavery is RIGHT, and oughtto be extended, while the other believes it is WRONG, and oughtnot to be extended.  This is the only substantial dispute.The fugitive-slave clause of the Constitution, and the law for thesuppression of the foreign slave-trade, are each as well enforced,perhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where the moralsense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself.The great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligationin both cases, and a few break over in each.  This, I think,cannot be perfectly cured; and it would be worse in both casesAFTER the separation of the sections than BEFORE.  The foreignslave-trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived,without restriction, in one section, while fugitive slaves,now only partially surrendered, would not be surrenderedat all by the other.Physically speaking, we cannot separate.  We cannot remove ourrespective sections from each other, nor build an impassable wallbetween them.  A husband and wife may be divorced, and go out ofthe presence and beyond the reach of each other; but the differentparts of our country cannot do this.  They cannot but remainface to face, and intercourse, either amicable or hostile,must continue between them.  Is it possible, then, to makethat intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory afterseparation than before?  Can aliens make treaties easier thanfriends can make laws?  Can treaties be more faithfully enforcedbetween aliens than laws can among friends?  Suppose you go to war,you cannot fight always; and when, after much loss on both sides,an no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old questionsas to terms of intercourse are again upon you.This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it.
Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government, they can exercisetheir CONSTITUTIONAL right of amending it, or their REVOLUTIONARY rightto dismember or overthrow it.  I cannot be ignorant of the factthat many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of having thenational Constitution amended.  While I make no recommendation ofamendments, I fully recognize the rightful authority of the peopleover the whole subject, to be exercised in either of the modes prescribedin the instrument itself; and I should, under existing circumstances,favor rather than oppose a fair opportunity being afforded the peopleto act upon it.  I will venture to add that to me the convention modeseems preferable, in that it allows amendments to originate withthe people themselves, instead of only permitting them to take orreject propositions originated by others not especially chosenfor the purpose, and which might not be precisely such as they wouldwish to either accept or refuse.  I understand a proposed amendmentto the Constitution--which amendment, however, I have not seen--haspassed Congress, to the effect that the Federal Government shallnever interfere with the domestic institutions of the States,including that of persons held to service.  To avoid misconstructionof what I have said, I depart from my purpose not to speak of particularamendments so far as to say that, holding such a provision to now beimplied Constitutional law, I have no objection to its being made expressand irrevocable.The chief magistrate derives all his authority from the people,and they have conferred none upon him to fix terms for theseparation of the states.  The people themselves can do thisalso if they choose; but the executive, as such, has nothing todo with it.  His duty is to administer the present government,as it came to his hands, and to transmit it, unimpaired by him,to his successor.Why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justiceof the people?  Is there any better or equal hope in the world?In our present differences is either party without faith of beingin the right?  If the Almighty Ruler of Nations, with his eternaltruth and justice, be on your side of the North, or on yoursof the South, that truth and that justice will surely prevail,by the judgment of this great tribunal, the American people.By the frame of the government under which we live, this same peoplehave wisely given their public servants but little power for mischief;and have, with equal wisdom, provided for the return of that littleto their own hands at very short intervals.  While the people retaintheir virtue and vigilance, no administration, by any extreme ofwickedness or folly, can very seriously injure the governmentin the short space of four years.My countrymen, one and all, think calmly and WELL upon thiswhole subject.  Nothing valuable can be lost by taking time.If there be an object to HURRY any of you in hot haste to a stepwhich you would never take DELIBERATELY, that object will befrustrated by taking time; but no good object can be frustrated
by it.  Such of you as are now dissatisfied, still have theold Constitution unimpaired, and, on the sensitive point,the laws of your own framing under it; while the new administrationwill have no immediate power, if it would, to change either.If it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied hold theright side in the dispute, there still is no single good reasonfor precipitate action.  Intelligence, patriotism, Christianity,and a firm reliance on him who has never yet forsaken this favored land,are still competent to adjust in the best way all our present difficulty.In YOUR hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in MINE,is the momentous issue of civil war.  The government will not assail YOU.You can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors.YOU have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government, while _I_shall have the most solemn one to "preserve, protect, and defend it."I am loathe to close.  We are not enemies, but friends.  We must notbe enemies.  Though passion may have strained, it must not breakour bonds of affection.  The mystic chords of memory, stretching fromevery battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstoneall over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Unionwhen again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.
